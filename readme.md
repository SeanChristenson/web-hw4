So I did use chat.gpt to help me write some of the code. And for a bit I really thought I was using it as a crutch but when it was having a hard time fixing what I was asking it to fix I noticied the mistake it actually made and fixed it myself. So I do beleive I am actually learning from it. It usually doesn't make problems with its code but I am able to notice the issues when it can't.
